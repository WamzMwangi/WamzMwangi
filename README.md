### AgData Scientist🌾| Data Detective 🔍|Computer Vision Practitioner 🛰️👁️‍🗨️

Hi, I'm Wambui, a trained Agricultural Engineer, Data Scientist and lover of all things agriculture!I am on a missin to **contextualize** smallholder agriculture across Africa, and equip farmers with farm-specific data insights so they can make the right decisions for **their** farm productivity. I believe the answer lies in building scalable solutions at the intersection of agricultural science + computer vision + remote sensing.
On my journey to make agriculture smarter, this year I have been tinkering with computer vision models, exploring how these models can be used to extract insights from satellite images. From segmentation models to vision transformers, the potential is huge and I look forward to sharing my work and collaborating!
